# SQRL Test Vectors
A suite of test vectors to aid developers of SQRL clients (and possibly servers?)

## Vector files

- **enscrypt-vectors.txt** - A CSV text file of 80 test vectors for EnScrypt varying 
  in number of iterations, salt, and password. *Created by Shane Killian. Verified
  by PHolder and Alex Hauser.*
- **enhash-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 1000 test vectors for EnHash, encoded in
  Base64URL. *Created by Adam Comley. Verified by Shane Killian.*
- **base56-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 120 test vectors for Base56. Given an
  input in hexadecimal and a zero-based byte line number, test the result of the 
  Base56 encoding and the check char. *Created by Shane Killian. Still needs to be 
  verified.*
- **base56-full-format-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 128 vectors of differing lengths 
  for testing the base56 encoding used to create textual versions of binary identities. 
  The raw input bytes (random data was used for the test vectors instead of actual
  identity data) are offered either base64_url- or hex-encoded, output is the string 
  created by the base56 encoding, formatted with spaces and newlines (encoded with `\n`). 
  *Created by Alex Hauser. Fully verified by PHolder and partly verified by PaulF.*
- **identity-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 80 test vectors for creation of identity
  keys. Given the Identity Unlock Key (IUK), the Identity Lock Key (ILK) and the
  Identity Master Key (IMK) are derived. The IMK is then combined with a domain 
  name (and, in some cases, extensions) and an Alt-ID (if it exists) to result in 
  the website's public key identifying the user (the IDK). The IUK, ILK, IMK and 
  IDK are Base64URL-encoded. *Created by Shane Killian. Corrected by Alex Hauser.*
- **ins-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 48 test vectors for creation of the INS
  (INdexed Secret) given the user's IMK (base64-URL encoded), the domain name, and 
  the SIN (Secret INdex) provided by the server as a string. The resulting INS is
  Base64URL-encoded. *Created by Shane Killian.  Verified by Alex Hauser.*
- **identity-lock-vectors.txt** - A CSV file of 14 vectors for testing the
  Identity Lock protocol. Given an Identity Unlock Key (IUK) and a Random Lock
  Value (RLV), test the results of the Identity Lock Key (ILK), the Server Unlock
  Key (SUK), the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement for unlocking the identity (DHKA),
  and the Verify Unlock Key (VUK). All values hex-encoded. *Created by PHolder.*
